### OTG Viewer options

The Viewer can take to query parameter options which will change the way the Viewer is working and loading OTG.

* disableIndexedDb=boolean

  default: false - This options tells the Viewer to not store meshes, materials, etc... into a local database for faster future loading. Since OTG also share mesh definition via a hash code, models may share this data for faster experience.

  ex: http://localhost:7124/output.html?disableIndexedDb=true

* disableWebSocket=boolean

  default: false - This options tells the Viewer to only use HTTP request. By default, the Viewer gets meshes / materials definition via WebSockets. In case you only want to us HTTP, turn this option on.

  ex: http://localhost:7124/output.html?disableWebSockets=true

ex: Both together

ex: http://localhost:7124/output.html?disableIndexedDb=true&disableWebSockets=true
